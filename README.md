## Description
The notion of formulaicity has received increasing attention in disciplines and areas as
diverse as linguistics, literary studies, art theory and art history. In recent years, linguistic 
studies of formulaicity have been flourishing and the very notion of formulaicity has
been approached from various methodological and theoretical perspectives and with
various purposes in mind. The linguistic approach to formulaicity is still in a state of
rapid development and the objective of the current volume is to present the current explorations 
in the field. Papers collected in the volume make numerous suggestions for
further development of the field and they are arranged into three complementary parts. 
The first part, with three chapters, presents new theoretical and methodological 
insights as well as their practical application in the development of custom-designed
software tools for identification and exploration of formulaic language in texts. Two papers 
in the second part explore formulaic language in the context of language learning.
Finally, the third part, with three chapters, showcases descriptive research on
formulaic language conducted primarily from corpus linguistic and translation studies
perspectives. The volume will be of interest to anyone involved in the study of formulaic
language either from a theoretical or a practical perspective.
